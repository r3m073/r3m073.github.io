title: Journy - CLI Jornaling and Note Taking Program

## Because CLI is the only way to work
I decided to make a simple CLI (command line interface) program to take notes, or make journal entries. I spend a lot of time in terminal as it is, and having to dig around for a program, open it, and then type up an entry is kind of a pain in the ass. Especially when you can just type ```journy``` into terminal and hit enter and do it faster, easier, and with a cleaner, less distracting, interface.

### How to install Journy
Installing Journy is easy. Like the easiest thing you will ever do. You will need Python, and pip installed. On Arch based systems Python 3 should be preinstalled, but you can double check using ```python --version```. Once you've made sure you have Python 3 installed you can go ahead and use ```pip``` to install Journy. If ```pip``` isn't installed you can get it on Arch based systems by running ```pacman -S python-pip``` in terminal.

Now you're ready for the hardest step. You need to run the following command:

```pip install journy```

And that is it. You now have Journy installed, and can start using it any time with the command ```journy```.

### Future Plans for Journy
While Journy is perfectly usable in it's current state there are a few features on the list to be added in the future. And there may be more that come about as time go by. But, the goal is to keep it pretty minimal, and clean. There isn't much that is needed to save your input, and add it to a text file.
